# Mass Intune Enrollment for Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices (Post SCCM Agent Removal) - Implementation Plan

**Change Title:** Mass Enrollment of Hybrid Azure AD Joined Devices into Microsoft Intune

## 1. Impact Assessment

### 1.1. Positive Impacts

*   **Modern Device Management:** Transition to cloud-based Intune for enhanced flexibility, scalability, and modern management features.
*   **Simplified Management:** Centralized management through the Intune admin center, reducing reliance on on-premises SCCM infrastructure.
*   **Improved Security:** Leverage Intune's modern security features, compliance policies, and endpoint security capabilities.
*   **Cost Reduction:** Potential long-term cost savings by decommissioning SCCM infrastructure.
*   **Enhanced User Experience:** Enable modern workplace scenarios and potentially improve device performance by removing SCCM agent overhead.

### 1.2. Negative Impacts & Risks

*   **Service Disruption (Enrollment Phase):** Potential temporary disruption during the enrollment process, although designed to be seamless to end-users.
*   **Policy Transition Gaps:** Temporary gaps in policy enforcement during the transition period if Intune policies are not fully configured and deployed before SCCM agent removal.
*   **User Impact (Initial Policy Application):** Users might experience changes in device behavior as Intune policies are applied (e.g., password policies, application availability).
*   **Technical Issues (Enrollment Failures):** Potential for enrollment failures due to misconfigurations in Azure AD Connect, Hybrid Azure AD Join, Group Policy, or network connectivity.
*   **Increased Network Load (Initial Enrollment):**  A temporary increase in network traffic during the mass enrollment process.
*   **Administrator Learning Curve:** IT administrators may need to learn and adapt to Intune management workflows and policies.

### 1.3. Mitigation Strategies

*   **Phased Rollout:** Implement a phased rollout approach, starting with pilot groups before mass deployment.
*   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test the entire process in a lab environment, including SCCM agent uninstallation, Hybrid Azure AD Join verification, Intune enrollment, and policy application.
*   **Pre-Configuration of Intune Policies:**  Proactively configure essential Intune policies (compliance, configuration, endpoint security) before initiating mass enrollment.
*   **Clear Communication:** Provide clear communication to end-users about the upcoming changes, benefits, and any potential temporary impacts.
*   **Robust Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring of device enrollment status, policy compliance, and device health in Intune.
*   **Detailed Rollback Plan:** Develop and test a detailed rollback plan to revert devices to SCCM management if critical issues arise.
*   **Administrator Training:** Provide adequate training to IT administrators on Intune management and troubleshooting.

## 3. Rollback Plan

*   **Rollback Trigger:** If critical issues are encountered during or after mass enrollment that significantly impact device functionality, user productivity, or security, the rollback plan will be initiated. Examples: widespread enrollment failures, inability to apply essential policies, critical device functionality loss.
*   **Rollback Steps:**
    1.  **Disable Intune Auto-Enrollment GPO:** Disable the "Enable automatic MDM enrollment using default Azure AD credentials" Group Policy setting.
    2.  **Disable Hybrid Azure AD Join GPO (If necessary for full rollback):** If required to fully revert to the pre-Intune state, disable the "Register domain-joined computers as devices" Group Policy setting.
    3.  **Re-enable SCCM Agent Management (If applicable):** If you had a GPO to uninstall SCCM agent, disable it or modify it to re-install the SCCM agent. Alternatively, prepare a manual SCCM agent re-installation package for deployment.
    4.  **Force Group Policy Update:** Force a Group Policy update on devices in affected OUs (`gpupdate /force`).
    5.  **Restart Devices:** Restart devices to ensure GPO changes are fully applied.
    6.  **Verify SCCM Agent Re-installation (If applicable):** Confirm SCCM agent re-installation and functionality on rolled-back devices (if applicable).
    7.  **Monitor Device Management in SCCM (If applicable):** Verify devices are again reporting and being managed by SCCM (if applicable).
    8.  **Communication:** Communicate the rollback to stakeholders and end-users, explaining the reason for the rollback and next steps.
*   **Responsible:** \[Team/Individual responsible for rollback execution]
*   **Timeline for Rollback:** \[Estimated timeframe for complete rollback, e.g., within 24-48 hours depending on device count]

## 4. Communication Plan

*   **Stakeholders:** IT Management, Help Desk, End-Users, Security Team, Compliance Team.
*   **Communication Channels:** Email, Intranet announcements, Team meetings, Help Desk knowledge base.
*   **Communication Timeline & Content:**
    *   **Phase 1 (Preparation & Testing):**  Inform IT Management and Help Desk about the upcoming project, testing phase, and expected timelines. (Email/Meeting - \[Date])
    *   **Phase 2 (Pilot Rollout):** Announce pilot program to pilot users, explaining the benefits and providing instructions. Inform all stakeholders about the pilot commencement. (Email/Intranet - \[Date])
    *   **Phase 3 (Mass Rollout - Pre-Wave Communication):**  Communicate to users in each rollout wave a few days prior to their devices being transitioned. Explain the changes, benefits, and provide basic troubleshooting steps and Help Desk contact information. (Email - \[Date before each wave])
    *   **Phase 3 (Mass Rollout - Post-Wave Communication):**  After each wave, provide a summary update to stakeholders on the progress and any issues encountered. (Email - \[Date after each wave])
